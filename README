THE PROBLEM

Ubuntu 18.04 switched display managers -- from lightdm to gdm3 -- changing how user authentication and graphical logins are 
handled. Connecting remotely to a machine when the same user, or a different user, is logged in locally on that machine results 
in a black screen. This is likely due to a GUI session control lock and is commonly thought of as a bug.

A SOLUTION

The problem can be remedied by changing the display manager back to lightdm and, optionally, installing x11vnc.

1. Install lightdm

sudo apt-get install lightdm 

2. Change the default display manager to lightdm

sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm

3. Check the default display manager

cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager

4. Remove the pre-installed display manager

sudo apt-get remove gdm3

5. Install x11vnc server

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install x11vnc net-tools -y

6. Create a password for x11vnc server

x11vnc -storepasswd

7. Create a systemd service file named x11vnc.service in /etc/systemd/system 

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/x11vnc.service

8. Paste the following into your service file and save it (replace USERNAME with your own):

[Unit]
Description=VNC Server for X11
Requires=display-manager.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -display :0 -auth guess -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /home/USERNAME/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5900 -shared
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

9. Reload systemd

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

10. Enable x11vnc starting on boot

sudo systemctl enable x11vnc

11. Start the x11vnc service

sudo systemctl start x11vnc

12. Ensure that the service is active and running without errors

sudo systemctl status x11vnc
